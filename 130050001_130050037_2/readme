Note: Client requests for files only from 1-1000, this can be changed by modifying
    multi-client.c.

Experimental setup:
    Server and Client are connected over local ethernet(100 Mbps), with single switch
    in between.

How to Run:
    If 'files' directory is not present in working directory run 'make all',
    else run 'make'.
    run server and client using commands given below.

    Note: comment/uncomment the lines(number given in multi-client.c) in multi-client.c
        to allow client to write in file the received data. If running locally and
        writing is enable keep client and server in different directory.


Makefile commands:
    make: creates server client executable
    make files: generates 2MB sample random files in files directory
    make clean: deletes server client executable
    make distclean: deletes sample files and all executables

Server running commands:
    ./server-mp <port-number>

Client running commands:
    ./multi-client <server-address> <port-number> <users> <time> <wait> <random/fixed>
